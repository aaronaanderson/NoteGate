# NoteGate
A simple MIDI plugin that takes in MIDI data and only passes through a selected note. 

As an example use case, you could send a midi drumset track to a sampler, and also send the data to another track to isolate the kick. This way, you can have the MIDI drums set on one midi track, but have a separate sampler for each drum.
